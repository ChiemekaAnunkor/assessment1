// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.

*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain;

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";
const analysisOFRequirements =
  " This is the second step, analysis of the different techonolgies being uses. Business analysts gather requirements from their customers, target market, and industry experts";
const design = " this is the third step, it involves product architecture, tasks will be deligated and product design will be created ";
const implementation = "this is the fourth step, involves building out the code using a variety of specified tools and programs";
const testingIntegration = "this is the fifth step, running test using testing methodologies such as unit,e2e,load testing. Then, the code is deployed once testing is completed";
const Maintain = "this is the last step, which is used to maintaince code and are on call incase of any breaks in the code  ";
